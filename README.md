# ESP3D 3.0 alpha stage

<img src="https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/blob/3.0/images/Screen/logo2.png">
<H3>Do not use it for production, in alpha stage for 3D printer/Sand-Table and CNC - breaking changes can happen anytime - just be aware of that, but feel free to test it and feedback</H3>

To compile ESP3D you need to edit the configuration.h according your needs.   
You can also generate it, using [![Development  Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ESP3D-Configurator-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=preact)](https://luc-github.github.io/) which simplify a lot this step.   
or click here: https://luc-github.github.io/      

ESP3D V3 use ESP3D-WebUI 3.0, but it is built according your system and your system firmware:   
 https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI/tree/3.0/dist/, so you need to use the right one, the [ESP3D-Configurator](https://luc-github.github.io/) may also help you to download the correct version for your needs.
